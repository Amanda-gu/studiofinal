	<div class="p2">This pandemic has slowed the world down and caused a lot of stress for many people like me. I'm under quarantine in new york and couldn't go back to my family. Staying at home has made me feel less connected to the world. Despite the delimma the pandemic has put us in, we should look at the positives and get the best out of it.
